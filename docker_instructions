Step 1: Dockerfile

Create a file named Dockerfile in your project directory with the following content:

Dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Run the application when the container launches
CMD ["python", "budget_app.py"]

Step 2: requirements.txt

Create a requirements.txt file in your project directory listing the required Python libraries:

pandas
openpyxl

Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory containing the Dockerfile and requirements.txt, and run the following command to build your Docker image:

sh

docker build -t budget-app .

This command will build a Docker image named budget-app using the instructions in your Dockerfile.
Step 4: Run the Docker Container

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a Docker container using the following command:

sh

docker run -it --rm budget-app

This command will start a Docker container from the budget-app image and run your budget tracking application inside the container.
